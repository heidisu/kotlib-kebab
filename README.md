Little ML'er in Kotlin - a workshop

This is the kotlin version of the [F# Kebab workshop](https://github.com/bjartwolf/Kebab). Kotlin isn't a language in the ML family, but there are things to learn from ML and some of the concepts have similar constructions in Kotlin.

The exercises are based on this book, you should buy it if you are interested in knowing more about this and getting the proper explanations.

The reason for the name of the workshop might become more clear if you do some of the exercises and/or read the book.
